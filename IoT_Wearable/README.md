## Background/Objective

> Explain why this feature is created. Provide context or background information that helps others understand the purpose and goals of this project/feature.

## Getting Started

> Provide step-by-step instructions for running the project on a local machine. This should include setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running the necessary scripts or commands.

### Prerequisites

> List any prerequisite libraries, frameworks, or packages that need to be installed before using the project. Include links to the relevant website or download page.

### Installation

> If the project includes pre-built binaries, provide instructions for downloading and installing them.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure compartmentalizes the three aspects of our project, 
- CAD_Designs
    - Contain the designs for our case and custom PCB
- Codebase
    - Contains the functioning code in [Complete Code](https://github.com/Redback-Operations/Elderly_Wearable_Tech/tree/main/IoT_Wearable/Codebase/Complete_Code) as well as experiments, examples and archived efforts in their respective folders.
- Documentation
    - Contains written and visual deliverables, research notes, datasheets and guides. More yet to come.
