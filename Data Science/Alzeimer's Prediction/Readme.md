Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Model
Introduction
Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that gradually destroys memory and thinking skills and eventually the ability to carry out simple tasks. It is the most common cause of dementia among older adults. The disease involves a buildup of proteins in the brain, leading to the death of brain cells. There is no cure, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.
