# Elderly Wearable Tech Project T1

## Introduction

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Elderly Wearable Device project, managed by Manan Gangar from the Data Science team. This repository contains code and resources related to developing features for an elderly care wearable device, focusing on both Voice Assistant and Fall Detection functionalities.

## Project Details

I am actively involved in the development of the following features within this repository:

- **Voice Assistant Feature**
- **Fall Detection Feature**

## Voice Assistant Feature

The Voice Assistant feature for the elderly care wearable device aims to cater to the needs of elderly individuals with accessibility challenges, offering hands-free assistance through voice commands.

### Primary Features

- **Health Monitoring:** Offers real-time information on oxygen and heart rate levels for user awareness.
- **Symptom Queries:** Assists users in querying symptoms and provides relevant health information.
- **Time and Weather Queries:** Provides responses to inquiries about the current time and weather updates.
- **Appointment Reminders:** Future consideration to notify elderly users about upcoming appointments and calendar events.

## Fall Detection Feature

The Fall Detection feature is designed to promptly detect falls in elderly individuals and notify emergency contacts or healthcare workers.

### Primary Features

- **Emergency Notifications:** Immediately alerts emergency contacts upon detecting a fall.
- **Abnormal Walking Patterns:** Furture consideration to identify abnormal walking patterns indicative of potential injuries.
- **Real-time Activity Monitoring:** Future consideration to monitor user activities such as walking and climbing.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/Data Science/Voice Assistant**: Contains code and resources related to developing the Voice Assistant feature.
- **/Data Science/Fall Detection**: Contains code and resources related to the development of the Fall Detection feature.
