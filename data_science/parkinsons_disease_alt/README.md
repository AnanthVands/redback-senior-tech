# Parkinson's Disease (PD) Wrist-Mounted Prediction Model

## Model Objective:
The objective of this model is to utilise data extracted from sensors on a wrist-mounted device to determine if a user is experiencing hand tremors, which are a symptom of Parkinson's Disease.

## Model Focus and Limitations

Unlike previous models, this is specifically built to utilise retrievable data from a wrist-worn device. Supervised learning techniques will be used to classify valid and invalid movements.

**Focus:**
- Utilise LSM6DS3 module on Arduino Nano 33 IoT to detect hand tremors (3D accelerometer, 3D gyroscope)
- Determine if readings from wrist-worn device are hand tremors and classify them as symptoms of Parkinson's Disease

**Limitations:**
- Data is only retrievable from wrist-mounted device, data from other sensors is not applicable
- Dataset will be spoofed due to limitations in acquiring dataset from ethical source
